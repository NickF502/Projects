! Note: The two kinetic energies do not always agree. For smaller speeds,
! the reletavistic calculation returns a value of zero. This is because
! it calculates a small value divided by a large number, producing a very
! small number. This very small number is rounded off to zero, as Fortran
! cannot accurately store all of these numbers. This produces gamma equal
! to 1, which produces a KE of magnitude zero.

  real :: gamma               ! The Lorentz factor
  real :: gamma_root          ! The sqrt function of Lorentz factor

  write(*,*) "Enter a mass in kilograms."
  read(*,*) mass

  write(*,*) "Enter a speed in meters per second."
  read (*,*) speed

  gamma_root = sqrt(1 - ((speed**2)/(C**2))) !Broken up into two parts
  gamma = 1 / gamma_root                     !For easier calculations
  
  ke_rel = mass * C**2 * (gamma - 1)
  ke_nonrel = (mass * speed**2) / 2.0
